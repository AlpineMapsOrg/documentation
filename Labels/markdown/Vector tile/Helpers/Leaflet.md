# Leaflet
In order to visualize vector tiles in a simple 2D map you can use something like leaflet.
An index.html file with leaflet code is located in the  https://github.com/AlpineMapsOrg/martin_config repository.
In order to specify which tables are shown you have to edit the JavaScript code in the .html file. 

**To start a server and serve this file run the following command:**
```sh
python -m http.server 8080
```
